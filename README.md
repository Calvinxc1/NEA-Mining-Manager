# NEA - Mining Fleet Manager
As a long-time EVE Online player, one challenge I've dealt with is not having a convenient way of tracking the yeild of a mining group. This is necessary to know how much to divvy up among mining group members after the mining results are tallied. I'm designing this tool to assist in this and allow me to allocate mining portions based on actual yeild mined, modified by fleet boosters & mining security.

## Minimum Viable Product (v1)
* Identifies group membership for a mining fleet.
* Pulls mining rate during mining activities for each member.
* Does post-hoc calculations on the total mined value as well as each person's share
